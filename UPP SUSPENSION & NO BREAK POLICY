Recommend indefinitely suspending UPP

Limited Customer Benefit	
    As expected, early reads for these changes 
    forbearance enrollment rates have increased (i.e., we are helping more customers with short-term hardships) and
    swap out volumes are significantly lower than expected. 

    While UPP is effective on a stand-alone basis, 
    Paydown is more effective than UPP given longer-term customer benefits (no post-program “payment shock”) and 
    more scheduled payments. 

Significant Non-Credit Risks 	
    Several major OCC-regulated issuers (e.g., Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Synchrony) 
    have stopped offering short-term forbearance programs due to 
    complexity, regulatory issues / risk, and/or negative customer experience (“payment shock”)

No payment break policy will increase Paydown effectiveness.
